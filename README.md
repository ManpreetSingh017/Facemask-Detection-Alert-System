# Face-Mask-Detection-Alert-System
My project is basically based on Deep Learningâ€™s Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) architecture . It contains facemask classifier whose task is to detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not in the image, if he/she is not wearing a mask it sends an alert email to authorities containing attached image of that individual.

To get an idea of how this project actually works, please go through the Project Presentation file in which I have thoroghly explained this project.
